This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl when handling undefined variables. The `bug.pl` file contains code that attempts to compare a variable to `undef` using the `eq` operator, which always returns false even if the variable is undefined. The correct solution, shown in `bugSolution.pl`, uses the `defined()` function to check if a variable is defined.
